- 👋 Hi, I’m @shammersdog
- 🏳️‍🌈 Every month is pride month
- 👀 I’m interested in breaking things and putting them back together
- 💀 I already "know" C, C++, Python, Bash, and Java

- 📫 How to reach me: https://shamme.rs
- 😄 Pronouns: I do not wish to be perceived
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not actually a dog IRL
- ⚡ Another fun fact: I hate doing front-end web development. A lot.
